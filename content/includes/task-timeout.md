> [!NOTE]
> Pipelines may have a job level timeout specified in addition to a task level timeout. If the job level timeout interval elapses before your step completes, the running job (including your step) is terminated, even if the step is configured with a longer timeout interval. For more information, see [Timeouts](phases.md#timeouts).
