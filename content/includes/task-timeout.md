> [!NOTE]
> Pipelines may be configured with a job level timeout. If the job level timeout interval elapses before your step completes, the running job (including your step) is terminated, even if the step is configured with a longer `timeoutInMinutes` interval. For more information, see [Timeouts](/azure/devops/pipelines/process/phases).
